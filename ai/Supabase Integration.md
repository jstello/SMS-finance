# Benefits of using Supabase

## Rapid Development and Reduced Complexity
Supabase auto-generates RESTful APIs from your PostgreSQL database, which means you can avoid writing boilerplate code. This accelerates backend development and lets you focus on building business logic and user experience.

## Built on a Robust PostgreSQL Backend
With PostgreSQL at its core, Supabase provides:
- Advanced SQL support and complex query capabilities
- Reliable handling of relational data and transactional integrity
- Scalability for growing datasets and user bases

## Real-Time Data Synchronization
Supabase provides real-time subscriptions that allow your application to instantly update UIs when changes occur in your database. This means users can see new transaction data or updates without needing to refresh manually.

## Integrated Authentication and Authorization
Supabase offers a built-in authentication system that supports:
- Email/password logins
- Social logins (OAuth providers)
- Magic links and other passwordless methods  
This ensures a secure, flexible, and hassle-free way to manage user sessionsâ€”a critical requirement for commercial-grade applications.

## Object Storage and File Management
If your app will handle images, receipts, or other media, Supabase's storage capabilities can manage these assets seamlessly while maintaining security and scalability.

## Serverless Edge Functions
For custom business logic or automated workflows, Supabase's support for serverless functions can be a flexible tool. This allows you to run custom code without managing traditional server infrastructure.

## Open Source and Avoiding Vendor Lock-In
Being open source, Supabase gives you greater control and flexibility. This is especially valuable in a commercial rollout where proprietary solutions might later limit customization or increase costs.
