# Building on Windows: Gradle Wrapper Usage

- We are on windows and by default we use cmd terminal.
- On Windows, use `gradlew` (not `.\gradlew`) to invoke the Gradle wrapper from the command prompt (cmd).
- Do **not** use `./gradlew` as you would on Unix-like systems; this will result in a command not recognized error.
- The user works in `cmd` and has `gradlew` available on their PATH.
- Example command to build a release APK:
  ```cmd
  .\gradlew assembleRelease
  ```
