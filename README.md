### üîß Using Your Own Firebase (Optional, for Privacy)

If you'd like to run the app locally without sharing any data with the main project's Firebase backend, you can easily set up your own! This ensures your SMS data and transaction history stay completely private to your device and your own Firebase instance.

Here's how:

1.  Visit the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new Firebase project (or use an existing one).
2.  Inside your project, register a new Android app.
3.  Make sure to use the package name: `com.example.finanzaspersonales`.
4.  Download the `google-services.json` configuration file that Firebase provides.
5.  Place this downloaded file directly into the `app/` folder of your cloned project.

That's it! When you build and run, the app will automatically connect to *your* private Firebase project.
